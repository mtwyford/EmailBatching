Instructions of how to do the various steps and some of the specifics of looping through rows of people, etc.
Project sending HTML format emails over CDO Windows 2000

Thanks to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNGd_9jedbQ (#Make Use Of) for giving me a great refresher on VBA Scripting and using Excel, CDO and Gmail together!

I started with Excel
Modified Email settings in gmail
Created some basic data
then added more data
added html to the body of my email and had to learn a little more
housed my online graphics on Repl.it site
(whach is where I also tested all my HTML  - esp when I screwed up the tables and layout)
just simple see through button icons for twitter and facebook links were a pain.

converted email format to html
redid html to concatenate one line/HTML element set at a time
  to build the email itself - rather lengthy after a while
  
tested, tested, and tested some more
emailed my son soo many times... ;)

added for loop to iterate through the planned 400 names
then tested some more and fired away...

** I will come back to this project - adding screenshots, etc
let me know if you need some help



P.S. make sure you have a SOLID connection - my code crapped out several times when wifi slowed/dropped..
